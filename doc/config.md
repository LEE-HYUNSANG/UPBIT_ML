# Configuration File Overview

This document explains every JSON file under the `config/` directory. The file names follow the pattern
`[from]_[to]_[name].json` which shows which module generates the file and which module consumes it.
The descriptions below are written for planners who may be new to the project.


## f5_f1_monitoring_list.json
List of coins selected by the **F5** machine learning pipeline. Each entry includes
`symbol`, `thresh_pct` and `loss_pct`. The **F1** and **F2** modules
load this file to know which coins should be monitored in real time.

## f1_f5_data_collection_list.json
Coins that should be collected for ML training. The **F1** module maintains this list and the
**F5** data collector reads it.


## f1_f3_coin_positions.json
Current open positions. Initially generated by **F1** when importing account balances
and continuously updated by the **F3** order executor.

## f2_f2_realtime_buy_list.json
List of dictionaries produced by **F2** when a coin meets the ML and indicator
conditions. Each entry contains `symbol`, `buy_signal`, `rsi_sel`, `trend_sel`,
and `buy_count`. Only items where `buy_signal` is 1 and `buy_count` is 0 are
considered for new orders. Once a buy is filled the count changes to 1 to
prevent duplicate entries.

## f3_f3_realtime_sell_list.json
Stores `thresh_pct` and `loss_pct` for each symbol after a buy order is filled.
The values originate from `f5_f1_monitoring_list.json` and are consulted when
placing sell orders.

## f4_f2_risk_settings.json
This file has been removed. It previously stored legacy risk parameters such as stop percentages and trailing stop settings.

## f3_f3_order_config.json
Order execution defaults such as retry counts and quantity settings. Used only by **F3**.

## f3_f3_dynamic_params.json
Dynamic parameters for averaging and pyramiding controlled at runtime by **F3**.


## f5_f5_strategy_params.json
Default hyperparameters for each strategy used by the ML pipeline.

## f4_f3_latest_config.json
Primary risk management configuration loaded by **F4**. Updated values are mirrored to
**F3** in real time.

## f4_f3_default_config.json
A template file containing safe default risk settings. It can be copied over the latest
file when resetting the system.

## f4_f3_ml_config.json
Alternative risk settings used during machine learning experiments.

## f4_f3_yesterday_config.json
Snapshot of yesterday's risk configuration stored for reference.
