# Configuration File Overview

This document explains every JSON file under the `config/` directory. The file names follow the pattern
`[from]_[to]_[name].json` which shows which module generates the file and which module consumes it.
The descriptions below are written for planners who may be new to the project.


## f5_f1_monitoring_list.json
List of coins selected by the **F5** machine learning pipeline. Each entry includes
`symbol`, `thresh_pct` and `loss_pct`. The **F1** and **F2** modules
load this file to know which coins should be monitored in real time.

## f1_f5_data_collection_list.json
Coins that should be collected for ML training. The **F1** module maintains this list and the
**F5** data collector reads it.


## f1_f3_coin_positions.json
Current open positions. Initially generated by **F1** when importing account balances
and continuously updated by the **F3** order executor.

## f2_f2_realtime_buy_list.json
List of dictionaries produced by **F2** when a coin meets the ML and indicator
conditions. Each entry contains `symbol`, `buy_signal`, `rsi_sel`, `trend_sel`,
and `buy_count`. Only items where `buy_signal` is 1 and `buy_count` is 0 are
considered for new orders. Once a buy is filled the count changes to 1 to
prevent duplicate entries.

## f3_f3_realtime_sell_list.json
Stores `thresh_pct` and `loss_pct` for each symbol after a buy order is filled.
The values originate from `f5_f1_monitoring_list.json` and are consulted when
placing sell orders.

## f4_f2_risk_settings.json
This file has been removed. It previously stored legacy risk parameters such as stop percentages and trailing stop settings.

## f3_f3_order_config.json
Order execution defaults such as retry counts and quantity settings. Used only by **F3**.

## f6_buy_settings.json
Buy order settings controlled via the web UI. It stores `ENTRY_SIZE_INITIAL`,
`MAX_SYMBOLS`, `MAX_RETRY`, `SLIP_MAX` and `ORDER_FAIL_RETRY` which default to
`10000`, `7`, `3`, `0.15` and `3` respectively. These values override the order
executor's defaults and are mirrored to the risk manager.
## f5_f5_strategy_params.json
Default hyperparameters for each strategy used by the ML pipeline.
