# Configuration File Overview

This document explains every JSON file under the `config/` directory. The file names follow the pattern
`[from]_[to]_[name].json` which shows which module generates the file and which module consumes it.
The descriptions below are written for planners who may be new to the project.


## f5_f1_monitoring_list.json
List of coins selected by the **F5** machine learning pipeline. Each entry includes
`symbol`, `thresh_pct` and `loss_pct`. The **F1** and **F2** modules
load this file to know which coins should be monitored in real time. This file
is cleared whenever `app.py` starts.

## f1_f5_data_collection_list.json
Coins that should be collected for ML training. The **F1** module maintains this list and the
**F5** data collector reads it.


## f1_f3_coin_positions.json
Current open positions. Initially generated by **F1** when importing account balances
and continuously updated by the **F3** order executor.

## f2_f2_realtime_buy_list.json
List of dictionaries produced by **F2** when a coin meets the ML and indicator
conditions. Each entry contains `symbol`, `buy_signal`, `rsi_sel`, `trend_sel`,
`buy_count` and `pending`. Only items where `buy_signal` is 1 and
`buy_count` is 0 are considered for new orders. Once a buy is filled the count
changes to 1 and this value is preserved on subsequent runs to prevent
duplicate entries. The `pending` flag reflects whether an order for the symbol
is currently being processed. This file is cleared whenever `app.py` starts.

## f3_f3_realtime_sell_list.json
Contains only the list of symbols currently held. A symbol is added when a buy
order fills and removed once the position is closed. The ML buy list keeps
`buy_count` at 1 for any symbol present here. The file is recreated on startup
based on existing account balances.

## f4_f2_risk_settings.json
This file has been removed. It previously stored legacy risk parameters such as stop percentages and trailing stop settings.

## f3_f3_pending_symbols.json
This file has been removed. Pending order status is now recorded directly in `f2_f2_realtime_buy_list.json` using the `pending` flag.

## f3_f3_order_config.json
Order execution defaults such as retry counts and quantity settings. Used only by **F3**.

## f6_buy_settings.json
Buy order settings controlled via the web UI. It stores `ENTRY_SIZE_INITIAL`,
`MAX_SYMBOLS`, `LIMIT_WAIT_SEC_1`, `1st_Bid_Price`, `LIMIT_WAIT_SEC_2` and
`2nd_Bid_Price`. Defaults are `10000`, `2`, `50`, `"BID1"`, `0` and `"ASK1"`
respectively. These values override the order executor's defaults and are
mirrored to the risk manager.

## f6_sell_settings.json
Take-profit settings for open positions. It currently stores `TP_PCT` which
specifies the percentage above the entry price to place a limit sell order
immediately after a buy fills. `OrderExecutor` loads this file on startup and
merges the values into its configuration.
## f5_f5_strategy_params.json
Default hyperparameters for each strategy used by the ML pipeline.
