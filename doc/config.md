# Configuration File Overview

This document explains every JSON file under the `config/` directory. The file names follow the pattern
`[from]_[to]_[name].json` which shows which module generates the file and which module consumes it.
The descriptions below are written for planners who may be new to the project.


## f5_f1_monitoring_list.json
List of coins selected by the **F5** machine learning pipeline. Each entry includes
`symbol`, `thresh_pct` and `loss_pct`. The **F1** and **F2** modules
load this file to know which coins should be monitored in real time. This file
is cleared whenever `app.py` starts.

## f1_f5_data_collection_list.json
Coins that should be collected for ML training. The **F1** module maintains this list and the
**F5** data collector reads it.


## f1_f3_coin_positions.json
Current open positions. Initially generated by **F1** when importing account balances
and continuously updated by the **F3** order executor.

## f2_f2_realtime_buy_list.json
List of dictionaries produced by **F2** when a coin meets the ML and indicator
conditions. Each entry contains `symbol`, `buy_signal`, `rsi_sel`, `trend_sel`,
`buy_count` and `pending`. Only items where `buy_signal` is 1 and
`buy_count` is 0 are considered for new orders. Once a buy is filled the count
changes to 1 and this value is preserved on subsequent runs to prevent
duplicate entries. The `pending` flag reflects whether an order for the symbol
is currently being processed. This file is cleared whenever `app.py` starts.

## f3_f3_realtime_sell_list.json
Contains only the list of symbols currently held. A symbol is added when a buy
order fills and removed once the position is closed. The ML buy list keeps
`buy_count` at 1 for any symbol present here. The file is recreated on startup
based on existing account balances.

## f4_f2_risk_settings.json
This file has been removed. It previously stored legacy risk parameters
such as stop percentages and trailing stop settings.

## f3_f3_pending_symbols.json
This file has been removed. Pending order status is now recorded directly in
`f2_f2_realtime_buy_list.json` using the `pending` flag.

## f3_f3_order_config.json
This file has been removed. `OrderExecutor` skips loading the file when
`config_path` is `None` or the path does not exist. Retry counts and default
quantities are now provided directly by the code.

## f6_buy_settings.json
Buy order settings controlled via the web UI. It stores `STARTUP_HOLD_SEC`,
`ENTRY_SIZE_INITIAL`, `MAX_SYMBOLS`, `LIMIT_WAIT_SEC_1`, `1st_Bid_Price`,
`LIMIT_WAIT_SEC_2`, `2nd_Bid_Price` and `FALLBACK_MARKET`. Defaults are `300`,
`7000`, `7`, `30`, `"BID1"`, `20`, `"BID1+"` and `false` respectively. The
startup delay disables new buys for the first N seconds after launching
`app.py` when greater than zero. These values override the
order executor's defaults and are mirrored to the risk manager. When
`FALLBACK_MARKET` is enabled the executor sends a market order if the first
limit order fails and no second attempt is configured.

## f6_sell_settings.json
Controls how open positions are closed. The keys are:

* `TP_PCT` – percentage above entry to place the initial take-profit order.
* `MINIMUM_TICKS` – minimum tick gap when calculating the TP price. If the
  rounded TP is within this many ticks of the entry price, it is moved up to
  maintain the gap.
* `TS_FLAG` – `'ON'` enables the trailing-stop logic while `'OFF'` disables it.
* `HOLD_SECS` – trailing stop becomes active once a position has been held at
  least this many seconds.
* `TRAIL_START_PCT` – gain percentage that must be reached before trailing stop
  monitoring begins.
* `TRAIL_STEP_PCT` – allowed drop from the peak price once trailing stop is
  active.

Defaults are `0.18`, `2`, `'OFF'`, `180`, `0.3` and `1.0` respectively.

`OrderExecutor` loads these settings on startup and stores them in its
configuration. The trailing-stop flag is converted to `TRAILING_STOP_ENABLED`
for `PositionManager`.
## f5_f5_strategy_params.json
Default hyperparameters for each strategy used by the ML pipeline.
